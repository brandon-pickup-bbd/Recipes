# Recipe API

## Summary
The idea here is to create a microservice that allows users to manage their favorite recipes. It allows adding, updating, removing, and fetching of recipes. Additionally, users are able to filter available recipes
based on one or more of the following criteria:
1. Whether or not the dish is vegetarian
2. The number of servings per recipe
3. Specific ingredients (either includes or excludes)
4. Search within the instructions

For example, the API should be able to handle the following search requests:
* All vegetarian recipes
* Recipes that can serve 4 persons and have “potatoes” as an ingredient
* Recipes without “salmon” as an ingredient that has “oven” in the instructions
